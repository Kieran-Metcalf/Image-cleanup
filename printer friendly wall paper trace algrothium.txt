Title this is a script for image of wallpaper
programs text editor 
objective to accept a bitmap and scan all pixels and change the file into a 2 tone image
the print out than can be used to recreate the heritage wallpaper
the 2 colours are 
programs to consider are GIMP

SELECT pixel 0,0,
READ Hue, Sat and Lum
	IF Hue is between 20 and 30 then 
		
	THEN change to colour Hue:=168 Sat:=142 Lum:=120 Red:=82 Green:=52 Blue:=202 *note this human eye perceives this as dark blue
OTHERWISE change to Hue:=160 Sat:=0 Lum:=240 Red:=255 Green:=255 Blue:=255 *this is white completely saturated and maximum photon flux, hue can be anything because it is multiplied by zero

*range hue 0 to 239 sat 0 to 240 Lum 0 to 240 RGB all 0 to 255
*
*hue variety of color caused by admixture of another, is the rainbow specifies the human eye reception of frequency of visible light quantised into pi=positive whole numbers between zero and 239
*saturation free from admixture of white, is the fraction of the hue which is displayed 0 being just the Luminosity showing
*Luminosity; a measure of the amount of luminescence light given off by a solid, a positive integer value proportional to the rate of photons emitted by the pixel. Analogous to brightness

* Summary Luminosity is the greyscale from black := 0 to white:= 240 and shades of grey in-between, Saturation is the fraction of hue added and Hue is the colour


Sample report:-
lum (greyscale) is always half everywhere; around 130 so can not use that as a decider
hue (color) is mostly blue when sampled form the leaves but varies
sat (grey*color mixture) are lo values for all the pixels

*so Hue is the only possibility to use in the colour match algorithm

Import bitmap wallpaper.btm
Define variable Hue :=positive integer between 0 and 239
Sat
Lum
start pixel X,Y
Define Xmax:= 1919
Ymax:= 2560
IF 122<Hue<192
THEN set Hue = 168 Sat = 142 Lum = 120
IF 0 < Hue < 121 OR 192 < Hue < 239
THEN set Hue=160 Sat=0 Lum=240
*move selected pixel raster scan across and down bitmap
X=X+1
loop until X=Xmax
then X=0, Y=Y=1
loop until X=Xmax 1919
loop until Y=Ymax 2560
